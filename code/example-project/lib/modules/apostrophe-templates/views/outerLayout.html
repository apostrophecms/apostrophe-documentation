{#
  This file extends Apostrophe's outerLayoutBase template, which we don't recommend
  overriding directly. Changes in this file, if any, are usually block overrides to
  modify the outer chrome, outside the main content area of the page. Most of the
  time you should just edit `layout.html` in the top level `views/` folder.
