## Getting Started

[The "getting started" tutorials](getting-started) are written for developers who are new to Apostrophe. They will walk you through the process of getting your environment set up and creating a basic website.

Practical examples of these concepts are illustrated in the [Open Musuem project, a fully featured Apostrophe site](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum). [You can access the code](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum) or [try a live demo](http://demo.apostrophecms.org).

## Core Concepts

[The Core Concepts tutorials](core-concepts) go through each piece of Apostrophe that you need to understand to build a webite.  They will help you get more comfortable with Apostrophe and node.js.

## Advanced Development

[Advanced Development](advanced-developments) dives deepers into the features of Apostrophe and the concepts behind it to provide the knowledge and tools you need to build dynamic, responsive sites.

## DevOps

[DevOps](devops) covers all you need to know to deploy and configure Apostrophe for a production environment.


## HOWTOs

[The HOWTOs](howtos) cover miscellaneous topics including development. configuration, and customization.

## What's the right level for me?

If you're brand new to Apostrophe, go to [Getting Started](getting-started) first to learn how to deploy Apostrophe locally for development and testing, and how to create a project. Once you have Apostrophe set up, [Core Concepts](core-concepts) will help you get a good grasp on Apostrophe's tools. After that, you can dig deeper with [Advanced Development](advanced-development) or get ready for production with [DevOps](devops).
