With the release of the [apostrophe-passport](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-passport) module, it has become very easy to implement login via Google, Twitter, Facebook, Github, Gitlab and other providers. 

See the [apostrophe-passport](https://npmjs.org/package/apostrophe-passport) documentation for complete examples of Gitlab and Google login configuration.

The same techniques can be applied to Twitter, Facebook, and almost any other authentication provider that has a [Passport strategy module](http://passportjs.org/). The `apostrophe-passport' module is a "universal bridge" compatible with pretty much all Passport strategies that follow the best practices laid down by Jared Hanson, the author of Passport.
