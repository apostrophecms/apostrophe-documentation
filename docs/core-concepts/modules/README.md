Each aspect of Apostrophe is divided into its own module. Pages, widgets, assets, and anything else are all divided into their own modules and loaded separately. For more information on how module loading works, you can read about it in [How Apostrophe Starts Up](/tutorials/advanced-development/how-apostrophe-starts-up.md).
