Practical examples of these concepts are illustrated in the "Open Musuem" project, a fully featured Apostrophe site. [You can access the code](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum) or [try a live demo](http://demo.apostrophecms.com).

## What's the right level for me?

If you're brand new to Apostrophe, go to [Setting Up Your Environment](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.md) first to learn how to set up Apostrophe locally for development and testing, then how to create a project. Once you have Apostrophe set up, [Core Concepts](/core-concepts) will help you get a good grasp on Apostrophe's tools.
