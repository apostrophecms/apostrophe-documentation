# Running Apostrophe on Windows

*Thanks to Andrew Brown for the original version of this HOWTO, which has been updated.*

## Step 1: Install Software

For Apostrophe 2 to work on Windows you need to install:

* Git
* Nodejs
* MongoDB
* Imagemagick (for image manipulation- required by Apostrophe)

## Where to get the software

To install git go to [Git - Downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the appropriate version. **Be sure when asked about adjusting your path environment you select "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt."**

To install Node go to [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/) and click install. Keep all settings the same and it will also make sure node and npm are accessible at the command line.

To install MongoDB go to [Downloads - MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) and select the proper download for your computer. Be sure to select 32 or 64 bit depending on your system. Follow all of the prompts.

To install Imagemagick go to: [ImageMagick : Windows Downloads](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) and download the latest version. Ensure that "add environmental variables to system path" is checked during the installation process. **Make sure you check the box to install legacy executables.**

## MongoDB setup

MongoDB should automatically start up and begin operation if you allowed it to install itself according to the defaults. If not, you will need to start it manually. See the MongoDB documentation.

## Step 2: You're good to go!

Be aware of the differences in syntax between macOS and Windows terminals. `cp` translates to `copy`, `rm` to `del`, etc.

Otherwise, the tutorial provided by [Apostrophe: Getting Started](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.md) can be followed.

NOTE: if you get permissions errors, you probably first created the site as Administrator. Make up your mind and stick to one user... which should not be Administrator. It is always a good security policy to avoid using an administrator account when you can.

> You may get a "Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this app" when you start Apostrophe on Windows for the first time. That's because Apostrophe is a type of web server, and any server process requires your permission. Be sure to grant it.
