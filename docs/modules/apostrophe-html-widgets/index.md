## Inherits from: [apostrophe-widgets](../apostrophe-widgets/index.html)
Provides the "raw HTML widget" (the `apostrophe-html` widget).
Use of this widget is not recommended if it can be avoided. The
improper use of HTML can easily break pages. If a page becomes
unusable, add `?safe_mode=1` to the URL to make it work temporarily
without the offending code being rendered.


## Methods
### addHelper()

### safeRender(*code*)
