## Tutorials

Our tutorials cover everything you need to know to get started as an Apostrophe developer. Everyone should start here. Our tutorials are progressive, so you can learn as you go. [The Getting Started tutorial](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.md) is a good place to get started.

### Getting Started

[The "getting started" tutorials](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.md) are written for developers who are new to Apostrophe. They will walk you through the process of getting your environment set up and creating a basic website.

### Core Concepts

[The Core Concepts tutorials](/core-concepts/technical-overview.md) go through each feature of Apostrophe that you need to understand to build a webite.  They will help you get more comfortable with Apostrophe and node.js.

Practical examples of these concepts are illustrated in the [Open Musuem project, a fully featured Apostrophe site](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum). [You can access the code](https://github.com/apostrophecms/apostrophe-open-museum) or [try a live demo](http://demo.apostrophecms.com).


### Advanced Development

[Advanced Development](/advanced-topics) dives deepers into the features of Apostrophe and the concepts behind it to provide the knowledge and tools you need to build dynamic, responsive sites.

## DevOps

[DevOps](/devops) covers all you need to know to deploy and configure Apostrophe for a production environment.

### HOWTOs

[The HOWTOs](/howtos) cover miscellaneous topics including development, configuration, and customization.

### What's the right level for me?

If you're brand new to Apostrophe, go to [Getting Started](/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.md) first to learn how to deploy Apostrophe locally for development and testing, and how to create a project. Once you have Apostrophe set up, [Core Concepts](/core-concepts/README.md) will help you get a good grasp on Apostrophe's tools. After that, you can dig deeper with [Advanced Development](/advanced-topics) or get ready for production with [DevOps](/devops).
