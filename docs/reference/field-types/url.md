# `url`

`url` adds an editable URL field to the schema.

::: tip
Apostrophe will detect common mistakes, like leaving off `http://`, and add them. Common XSS attack vectors are laundered and discarded. Only "safe" URL schemes, e.g. `http`, `https`, `ftp` and `mailto`, are permitted.

## Example

```javascript
{
  name: 'portfolio',
  label: 'Portfolio URL',
  type: 'url'
}
```
