# `attachment`

An `attachment` field allows the user to upload a file to the server, or replace a file which was previously [uploaded](../modules/apostrophe-attachments/README.md).

::: tip NOTE
The uploaded files are stored in a web-accessible folder, however their names are generated in a way which makes them mathematically impossible to guess.
:::

Once an attachment field has a value, you can obtain a URL to the file by calling `apos.attachments.url(attachment)`. If the file is an image, you can obtain images of any configured size by calling `apos.attachments.url(attachment, { size: 'one-half' })`, etc.

Attachments are most often used indirectly via [apostrophe-images-widgets](../../modules/apostrophe-images-widgets/README.md) or [apostrophe-files-widgets](../../modules/apostrophe-files-widgets/README.md), which are backed by the [apostrophe-images](../../modules/apostrophe-images/README.md) and [apostrophe-files](../../modules/apostrophe-files/README.md) subclasses of pieces. Each of those piece types contains an attachment field and some metadata fields, making them a convenient way to reuse files.

However, you may also use attachments directly in your own schemas. Doing so means that the file will not be available via a general-purpose "media library." It will only be readily accessible as a property of your object.

This is often appropriate for resumes, job applications and other attachments relating to a specific person.

## Example

```javascript
{
  type: 'attachment',
  name: 'resume',
  label: 'Resume',
  group: 'office'
}
```
