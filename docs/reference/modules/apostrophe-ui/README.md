# apostrophe-ui
## Inherits from: [apostrophe-module](../apostrophe-module/README.md)
Provides the [apos.ui](/reference/modules/apostrophe-ui/browser-apostrophe-ui.md) singleton on the browser side, which
implements various general purpose UI features for Apostrophe sites, and also
the [apostrophe-context](/reference/modules/apostrophe-utils/browser-apostrophe-context.md) base class on the browser side,
which is the base class of modals and of other types that benefit from being
able to make API calls conveniently via `self.action` and link click handlers based on
`self.$el`.
