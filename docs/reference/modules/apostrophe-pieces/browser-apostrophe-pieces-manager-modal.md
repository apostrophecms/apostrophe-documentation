# apostrophe-pieces-manager-modal (browser)
## Inherits from: [apostrophe-modal](../apostrophe-modal/browser-apostrophe-modal.md)
A "manage" modal for pieces, displaying them list and/or grid views and providing
filtering and sorting features. The manager modal is also extended on the fly
by the chooser for use as a more full-featured chooser when selecting pieces
to appear in a widget, such as a slideshow.


## Methods
### decorate()

### generateFilter(*filter*)
turn a filter config object into a working filter
### beforeShow(*callback*)

### enableFilters()

### enableBatchOperations(*callback*)
Enables batch operations, such as moving every selected
item to the trash. Maps the operations found in options.batchOperations
to methods, for instance `{ name: 'trash'}` maps to
a call to `self.batchTrash()`. Also implements the UI for
selecting and invoking a batch operation.
### reflectBatchOperation()
Invoked when a new batch operation is chosen to reflect it in the UI
by displaying the appropriate button and, where relevant, the
appropriate string field. Also invoked when the manage view is refreshed,
so that filters can impact which operations are currently enabled.
### enableBatchOperation(*batchOperation*, *callback*)
Preps for supporting a single batch operation, matching the operation name
to a method name such as `batchTrash` via the `name` property.
Also populates the subform for it, if any. Requires callback.
Invoked for you by `enableBatchOperations`. Do not invoke directly.
### enableInsertViaUpload()

### batchTrash()
Moves all selected items (`self.choices`) to the trash, after
asking for user confirmation.
### batchRescue()
Rescues all selected items (`self.choices`) from the trash, after
asking for user confirmation.
### batchPublish()
Publishes all selected items (`self.choices`), after asking for
user confirmation.
### batchUnpublish()
Unpublishes all selected items (`self.choices`), after asking for
user confirmation.
### batchTag()
Tags all selected items (`self.choices`), after asking for
user confirmation.
### batchUntag()
Untags all selected items (`self.choices`), after asking for
user confirmation.
### batchPermissions()

### getBatchPermissions(*data*, *callback*)

### batchSimple(*operationName*, *confirmationPrompt*, *options*)
Carry out a named batch operation, such as `trash`, displaying the
provided prompt and, if confirmed by the user, invoking the
corresponding verb in this module's API.

If `confirmationPrompt` is falsy, no prompt is displayed. Often
appropriate if `options.dataSource` presents another chance to cancel.

`options.dataSource` can be used to specify a function
to be invoked to gather more input before calling the API.
It receives `(data, callback)`, where `data.ids` and any
input gathered from the schema are already present, and
should update `data` and invoke `callback` with
null on success or with an error on failure.

`options.success` is invoked only if the operation
succeeds. It receives `(result, callback)` where
`result` is the response from the API and `callback`
*must* be invoked by the success function after
completing its additional operations, even if the user
chooses to cancel or skip those operations.
### enableSorts()

### getNextDirection(*defaultDirection*, *direction*)

### reflectSort()

### enableChooseViews()

### enableSearch()

### enableCheckboxEvents()
Enable checkbox selection of pieces. The ids of the chosen pieces are added
to `self.choices`. This mechanism is used for ordinary manager modals and their
bulk features, like "Trash All Selected". The chooser used for selecting
pieces for joins overrides this with an empty method and substitutes its
own implementation.
### shrinkGrid()
shrink and grow make visual reflectments to accommodate the the new Select Everything element
### growGrid()

### reflectSelectEverything()
reflect the modal's layout and size in response to
whether the select everything box should appear
at this time. Also reflect the state of the select
everything checkbox based on what is actually selected
### reflectSelectEverythingCheckbox()

### getSelectAll()

### enableSelectEverything()

### onElOrFilters(*e*, *sel*, *fn*)
Execute `fn` when the event `e` fires on the delegated selector `sel`.
If `self.$filters` is contained in `self.$el` the delegation is done
via `self.$el`, otherwise via `self.$filters`.
### addChoice(*id*)

### addChoiceToState(*id*)

### removeChoice(*id*)

### removeChoiceFromState(*id*)

### getIds()
Return just the ids of the choices. Subclasses
might need to extend this to avoid returning
other data associated with a choice. Unlike get()
this does not require a callback
### clearChoices()

### checkEverythingChoices()
When the "select everything" checkbox is checked,
we select all of the content
### clearEverythingChoices()
When the "select everything" checkbox is cleared,
we go back to selecting just the current page
of content
### getVisibleChoiceIds()
Get the ids of the currently visible choices (not necessarily checked)
### refreshSelectEverything()

### getSelectEverything()

### reflectChoicesInCheckboxes()
Reflect existing choices in checkboxes. Invoked by `self.refresh` after
the main view is refreshed. Important when the user is selecting items
while paginating. This mechanism is used for ordinary manager modals and their
bulk features, like "Trash All Selected". The chooser used for selecting
pieces for joins overrides this with an empty method and substitutes its
own implementation.
### reflectChoiceInCheckbox(*id*)
Reflect the current selection state of the given id
by checking or unchecking the relevant box based on
whether it is included in `self.getIds()`
### getCheckbox(*id*)
Return a jquery object referencing the checkbox for the given piece id
### getVisibleIds()
Return array of ids corresponding to the items currently visible
in the modal's list view, whether checked or not
### displayChoiceInCheckbox(*id*, *checked*)
Set the display state of the given checkbox. returns
a jQuery object referencing the checkbox, for the convenience
of subclasses that extend this
### reflectChoiceCount()

### reflectHasChoices()

### getListOptions(*options*)
Given an options object, returns a new object with
those options plus standard options for the list API,
such as `sort`, `search` and `manageView`. Also invokes
`self.beforeList`. Called by `refresh`.
### refresh(*callback*)

### beforeList(*listOptions*)
An initially empty method you can override to add properties to the
query object sent to the server to fetch another page of results. Also
used to build the query that goes to the server in a insert-via-upload
operation in order to make sure things like the `minSize` filter
of `apostrophe-images` are honored.
### afterRefresh()

### onChange(*type*)

### afterHide()
