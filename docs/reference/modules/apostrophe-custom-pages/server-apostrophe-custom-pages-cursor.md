# apostrophe-custom-pages-cursor (server)
Cursor for fetching docs of this specific type. The `afterConstruct`
method locks the results down to this type by calling the
`self.type` filter for us. Subclasses frequently add new filters.

We subclass `apostrophe-pages-cursor` so that cursors for page types
are able to use `.children()`, `.ancestors()`, etc.
