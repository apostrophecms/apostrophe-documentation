# apostrophe-groups
## Inherits from: [apostrophe-pieces](../apostrophe-pieces/README.md)
### `apos.groups`
Provide a way to group [apostrophe-users](/modules/apostrophe-users) together
and assign permissions to them. This module is always active "under the hood," even if
you take advantage of the `groups` option of `apostrophe-users` to skip a separate
admin bar button for managing groups. **To make an admin bar button available
for managing groups, do NOT set the `groups` option when configuring the
`apostrophe-users` module. That option configures a hardcoded list of groups
as a simplified alternative.**

By default the `published` schema field is removed. As a general rule we believe
that conflating users and groups, who can log into the website, with public directories
of people most often leads to confusion. Use a separate subclass of pieces to
represent departments, etc.

If you do add the `published` field back you will need to extend the cursor to make
`published(true)` the default again.

This module is **not** intended to be extended with new subclass modules, although
you may implicitly subclass it at project level to change its behavior.
