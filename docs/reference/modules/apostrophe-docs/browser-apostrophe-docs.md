# apostrophe-docs (browser)

## Methods
### getManager(*type*)

### setManager(*type*, *manager*)

### lock(*_id*, *callback*)
Obtain a lock on the given doc _id, interacting with the user
if necessary to give them the option of shattering another
user's lock. Invokes the callback with null on a successful lock,
an error otherwise. If `id` is falsy, the callback succeeds
immediately, because this indicates a new doc that no one
else could know about or have a lock on. The lock is
granted to the current html page.
### lockAndWatch(*_id*, *callback*)
Obtain a lock via the lock method, then
watch the lock by periodically verifying
whether the lock is still held. If the
lock is lost the user is notified and
the page is reloaded. This method is used
by the modal editor for pieces, since they
do not otherwise carry out autosave operations
that would quickly make the user aware a lock has
been seized by someone else.

The callback is invoked as soon as
the lock method succeeds, and monitoring
then proceeds in the background, stopping if unlock()
is invoked successfully.
### unlock(*_id*, *sync*, *callback*)
Release a lock on the given doc _id, if any.
Callback succeeds (receives `null`) as long as the
current HTML page does not have a lock anymore after
the call, whether they initially had one or not.

If `sync` is true a synchronous call is made.
This is normally a bad thing, but it is appropriate
in a beforeunload handler.

`callback` is optional.
### enableFix()
Watch for clicks on links with a [data-apos-fix-id], and open
the relevant document for editing, displaying the
[data-apos-fix-hint] first to explain why the document is being
opened and ask the user to confirm. This is designed for use cases
such as editing a document that is "camping" on the slug we want to
use for another document. The implementation of the hint is currently
an alert, but this API allows for us to gracefully upgrade that
at any time.

The data-apos-fix-id, data-apos-fix-type and data-apos-fix-url
attributes should be populated on your link or button.
If you know the doc is a piece, not a page, you can skip
the url attribute.

If data-apos-fix-error is present, the error with the same name
is removed from the enclosing fieldset when the link is clicked.
