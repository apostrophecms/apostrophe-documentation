# apostrophe-jobs (browser)
## Inherits from: [apostrophe-context](../apostrophe-utils/browser-apostrophe-context.md)

## Methods
### progress(*jobId*, *options*)
Start a progress display for the given job id.
If `options.change` is set, an `apos.change` call is
made with that argument when the progress display
is dismissed.

If `options.success` is set, it is
invoked after all items have been processed and
receives the `results` property provided by
the server at the end of the job; it is not invoked
if the operation was stopped or canceled by the user.
Note that `options.success` does not take a callback
because the modal has already been dismissed.
