# apostrophe-schemas (browser)
## Inherits from: [apostrophe-context](../apostrophe-utils/browser-apostrophe-context.md)
The browser-side singleton corresponding to the [apostrophe-schemas](/reference/modules/apostrophe-schemas/) module.


## Methods
### populate(*$el*, *schema*, *object*, *callback*)
Populate form elements corresponding to a set of fields as
specified in a schema (the schema argument). The inverse of
self.convert.

Must be called only once for a given set of elements. However,
you can call `convert` many times. Typical practice is to
create a modal, populate it with existing data, and then
attempt to convert it on save. If a conversion fails it is
OK to try again after the user corrects errors such as
absent required fields.
### beforePopulate(*$el*, *schema*, *object*, *callback*)
Invoked at the start of `populate`. Does nothing by default.
Provides a convenient way to extend the behavior of all
schemas. When implementing custom field types you should
not need to override this method, however it is sometimes useful for
concerns that cut across multiple methods.
### afterPopulate(*$el*, *schema*, *object*, *callback*)
Invoked at the end of `populate`. Does nothing by default.

### enableSlugSuggestions(*$el*, *schema*, *object*)
If the schema contains both `title` and `slug` fields, begin
monitoring `title` and updating `slug` as the user types,
provided it reflects the previous content of `title`.
### convert(*$el*, *schema*, *data*, *options*, *callback*)
Gather data from form elements and push it into properties of the data
object, as specified by the schema provided. The inverse of
self.populate. Errors, if any, are passed as an array to
the callback; if the first parameter is null all is well. In the
event of errors this method will still convert as many fields
as it can.

The options argument can be completely omitted.

By default, any errors are highlighted via showError().
If you explicitly set options.showErrors to false, errors are
not highlighted (but are still reported). This is useful
for autosave and similar operations.
### returnToError(*$el*, *schema*, *errorPath*, *error*, *callback*)

### error(*field*, *type*)
Create a valid error object to be reported from a converter.
You can also report a string as an error in which case self.convert
creates one of these for you. The object is nice if you want to
extend it with extra properties
### enableGroupTabs(*$el*)
Add click handlers for group tabs
### contextualConvertArea(*data*, *name*, *$el*, *field*)
Convert an in-context area, storing it in data[name],
if an editor is active
### contextualIsPresentArea(*$el*, *field*)
Returns true if an editor is actually active for the given area
### enableSingleton(*$el*, *name*, *area*, *type*, *_options*, *callback*)

### enableArea(*$el*, *name*, *area*, *options*, *callback*)
options argument may be skipped
### scheduleEvaQueue()

### runEvaQueue()

### getSingleton(*$el*, *name*)

### getArea(*$el*, *name*)
Retrieve a JSON-friendly serialization of the area
### addFieldType(*type*)

### showError(*$el*, *error*)
Make an error visible. You can use this in your own validation
code, see self.error() for an easy way to make an error object
### scrollToError(*$el*)
A convenience allowing you to scroll to the first error present,
if any. convert() will call this if an error is present.
Also ensures the appropriate tab group is actually visible.
### removeError(*$fieldset*, *error*)
Remove an error from the given fieldset. Not often required
because a fresh "convert" takes care of this completely,
but there are edge cases such as the "taken" error that
should be optimistically removed if the user elects to
use the wrench to edit the conflicting document.
### showGroupContaining(*$element*)
Show the tab group containing the given element, if not already visible,
by triggering the appropriate tab button.
### findFieldset(*$el*, *name*)
Used to search for fieldsets at this level of the schema,
without false positives for any schemas nested within it.
### findSafe(*$el*, *sel*)
Used to search for elements without false positives from nested
schemas in unrelated fieldsets, however see `findFieldset` or
`findSafeInFieldset` for what you probably want.

Optimized implementation at the DOM level, the jQuery
`findSafe` plugin is much slower. Still returns a
jQuery object, so there is no incompatibility with
existing code that uses this method.

### findSafeInFieldset(*$el*, *name*, *sel*)
A convenient way to find something safely within a specific fieldset
(safely means "not inside a nested schema"). The fieldset is found first,
then `sel` is located within it, without recursing into any nested
schema forms that may be present.
### findField(*$el*, *name*)
Used to search for simple elements that have a
"name" attribute, without false positives from nested
schemas in unrelated fieldsets.
### enhanceSelectiveWithSlugs(*$field*)

### newInstance(*schema*)
Return a new object with all default settings
defined in the schema
### enableTags(*$el*, *tags*, *field*)
Enable autocomplete of tags. Expects the fieldset element
(not the input element) and an array of existing tags already
assigned to this item. Exported for the convenience of
code that is not fully schema-based but wants to enhance
tag fields in the same way.
### enableSlug(*$title*, *$slug*, *title*, *slug*)
Reusable utility to watch the title and use it to
suggest valid slugs.

If the initial slug contains slashes, only the last component
(after the last slash) is changed on title edits.

If the original slug (or its last component) is not in sync with the
title, it is assumed that the user already made deliberate changes to
the slug, and the slug is not automatically updated.

`$title` and `$slug` are jQuery objects referencing the actually
input elements. `title` and `slug` are the schema field definitions.

This has become an implementation detail of enableSlugSuggestions
but for bc it remains a publicly available API.
