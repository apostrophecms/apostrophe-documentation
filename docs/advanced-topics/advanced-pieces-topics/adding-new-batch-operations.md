# Adding new batch operations for pieces

Apostrophe includes several handy batch operations on multiple pieces, such as "trash," "rescue from trash," "publish," "unpublish," "tag" and "remove tag." But sometimes you'll want a batch feature of your own.

Adding a custom batch action is not hard. For simplicity, let's pretend that the `publish` batch operation doesn't already exist, and we want to add it.

## Server side steps

### The `addBatchOperations` option

Set the addBatchOperations option, either for all `apostrophe-pieces` or for a specific subclass of pieces. Decide now, and follow the instructions below accordingly. These examples assume you want to do it for all kinds of pieces.

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/index.js
module.exports = {
  addBatchOperations: [
    {
      name: 'publish',
      label: 'Publish',
      // If the user's current filter only shows published stuff,
      // don't offer this operation
      unlessFilter: {
        published: true
      },
      // If the schema is missing this field, don't offer this operation
      requiredField: 'publish'
    }
  ]
}
```

> The `requiredField` option makes sure the `publish` field hasn't been removed from the schema altogether for this type of piece. It has nothing to do with requiring the user to do something.
> The `unlessFilter` option removes this batch operation when a particular filter in the manage view has a particular value. Apostrophe's boolean filters can be `true`, `false` or `null` (not filtering right now).

### The `publish` route

Next, add a route with the same name for your pieces module. (Remember, Apostrophe can already publish things, but we're demonstrating how to create that feature from scratch.)

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/index.js
module.exports = {
  addBatchOperations: [
    ... See above ...
  ],

  construct: function(self, options) {
    // also inside `construct`
    self.route('post', 'publish', function(req, res) {
      return self.batchSimpleRoute(req, 'publish', function(req, piece, data, callback) {
        piece.published = true;
        return self.update(req, piece, callback);
      });
    });
  }
```

This little callback does the actual work on the piece:

```javascript{10-13}
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/index.js
module.exports = {
  addBatchOperations: [
    ... See above ...
  ],

  construct: function(self, options) {
    // also inside `construct`
    self.route('post', 'publish', function(req, res) {
      return self.batchSimpleRoute(req, 'publish', function(req, piece, data, callback) {
        piece.published = true;
        return self.update(req, piece, callback);
      });
    });
  }
```

What you do inside that callback is up to you. In this example we publish the piece.

`batchSimpleRoute` takes care of everything else. You can pass the request, the name of the batch operation and the callback.

::: tip
Alternatively, you can write your own route from scratch. You'll receive the selected piece IDs via `req.body.ids`. However, keep in mind that if you try to get clever and use MongoDB `{ multi: true }` operations, Apostrophe won't know to call `docBeforeUpdate`, `docAfterSave` or any similar methods.

## Browser side steps

### Adding the `batchPublish` method to the manager modal

Let's add a method to `apostrophe-pieces-manager-modal`, the modal dialog type that gets created when we manage pieces:

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/public/js/manager-modal.js
apos.define('apostrophe-pieces-manager-modal', {
  construct: function(self, options) {
    self.batchPublish = function() {
      return self.batchSimple(
        'publish',
        "Are you sure you want to publish " + self.choices.length + " items?",
        {}
      );
    };
  }
});
```

`batchSimple` invokes the `publish` route for you, locks the UI, displays errors, and so on. You shouldn't need to bypass it, but if you really want to, check out the `batchSimple` source code as a starting point.

> By implicitly subclassing `apostrophe-pieces-manager-modal` at the project level, we are adding this feature for *all* types of pieces. You could also do this work in the folder for a specific subclass of pieces, in which case you would define `my-module-name-manager-modal` instead. If you do that, make sure you also follow all the server-side steps in the specific module you want, not `apostrophe-pieces`.

Boom! That's it: we now have a batch operation for publishing things. (OK, we already did, but now you know how to do something similar.)

## Batch operations with forms

Sometimes you'll want to implement a batch operation that needs input from the user. For that, you can use a simple form powered by Apostrophe's schemas.

Here's how the `tag` batch operation could be implemented, if we didn't already have it:

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/index.js
  addBatchOperations: [
    {
      name: 'tag',
      label: 'Add Tag to',
      buttonLabel: 'Add Tag',
      requiredField: 'tags',
      schema: [
        {
          type: 'tags',
          name: 'tags',
          label: 'Tag',
          required: true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> The schema seen here powers the form that appears when you select "add tag" from the batch operation dropdown menu.

Our module also needs a route to implement the operation on the back end:

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/index.js

// Inside construct, add this route
  self.route('post', 'tag', function(req, res) {
    return self.batchSimpleRoute(req, 'tag', function(req, piece, data, callback) {
      if (!piece.tags) {
        piece.tags = [];
      }
      piece.tags = _.uniq(piece.tags.concat(data.tags));
      return self.update(req, piece, callback);
    });
  });
```

On the browser side it's still trivial. Apostrophe's schemas do the hard work of helping the user pick a tag, and `batchSimple` delivers that information to the server for us along with the ids of the pieces.

```javascript
// lib/modules/apostrophe-pieces/public/js/user.js
apos.define('apostrophe-pieces-manager-modal', {
  construct: function(self, options) {
    self.batchTag = function() {
      return self.batchSimple(
        'tag',
        "Are you sure you want to tag " + self.choices.length + " items?",
        {}
      );
    };
  }
});
```

And that's it! Apostrophe's support for custom batch operations makes it much esier to help your users cope with large editing jobs.
