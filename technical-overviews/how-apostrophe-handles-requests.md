This HOWTO describes how Apostrophe handles requests, and in the process, introduces many ways you can intercept that process and modify the response sent to the browser.

### Middleware

Apostrophe's response to any request begins with [Express middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html).

When an HTTP request is made, the standard middleware added by the `apostrophe-express` module runs first, followed by the middleware supplied via the `expressMiddleware` property of individual modules. Middleware is added in the order the modules are initialized. `expressMiddleware` can be either a single function or an array of functions.

  An upcoming feature: pending merge of the `workflow-accommodations-1` branch, `expressMiddleware` can also be an object with a `before` property indicating the name of another module. In this case the `middleware` property is run *before* any middleware added by that other module. The `middleware` property can be a single function or an array of functions.

### Express Routes

Any module can add Express routes, either via `self.apos.app.get`, `self.apos.app.post` and friends (note that `self.apos.app` is the Express app object), or via `self.route('get', 'verb', function(req, res) { ... })`. Note that if you use `self.route`, the path of the module is prepended to your `verb` automatically. So the URL is:

`/modules/my-module-name/verb`

Note that on the browser side, any object that extends `apostrophe-context` or `apostrophe-module` can take advantage of the `self.html` and `self.api` methods to conveniently invoke the routes of a specific module without typing these URL prefixes everywhere.

Express routes are considered after the middleware, in the order added. They are typically added in `afterConstruct`. The best strategy is to implement a method such as `addRoutes` in `construct`, so it can be overridden by subclasses, but invoke it in `afterConstruct`.

### Page requests

At the last possible moment, in the `afterInit` method of the `apostrophe-pages` module, a wildcard route (matching `*`) is added to Express, which triggers the `serve` method of the `apostrophe-pages`module. This is how requests for pages are handled, if no other route matches the request. 

The `server` method of `apostrophe-pages` loads `req.data.bestPage`, which is the page matching at least a prefix component of the URL; it will always be the home page at the very least. 

`apostrophe-pages` then invokes the `pageServe` method of every module that has one, via `self.apos.callAll`. The most important implementation is in the `apostrophe-custom-pages` module. Every page type has a "manager" object which is an instance of a subclass of this module. Even "ordinary" page types like `home` and `default` automatically receive a subclass of this module.

### Ordinary page templates

By default, the `pageServe` method of `apostrophe-custom-pages` checks whether the slug of `req.data.bestPage` is an exact match for the request. If the page is an exact match, `req.data.page` is set accordingly.

The `apostrophe-pages` module then notes that `req.template` has not been set, and falls back to using `pages/PAGE-TYPE.html`, where `PAGE-TYPE` is the value of `req.data.page.type`.

### Dispatch: handling prefix URL matches with `apostrophe-custom-pages`

As mentioned, every page type is managed by a module that extends `apostrophe-custom-pages`. That module can call `self.dispatch` to add "dispatch routes" that match the URL, even if the page slug is only a prefix to that URL.

For instance, you might implement a module that displays an index if you request its URL exactly, and displays an individual document if you match the URL of the page plus the slug of the document:

```
// in app.js
modules: {
  'home-pages': {}
}

// in lib/modules/home-pages/index.js

module.exports = {
  afterConstruct: function(self) {
    self.addDispatchRoutes();
  },
  construct: function(self, options) {
    self.addDispatchRoutes = function() {
      self.dispatch('/', self.indexPage);
      self.dispatch('/:slug', self.showPage);
    };
    self.indexPage = function(req, callback) {
      req.template = self.renderer('index');
    };
    self.showPage = function(req, callback) {
      return goFindSomethingBySlug(req.params.slug, function(err, doc) {
        // handle err, if no err...
        if (!doc) {
          // Let Apostrophe render the 404 page
          req.notFound = true;
          return callback(null);
        }
        req.template = self.renderer('show', { doc: doc });
      });
    };
  }
};
```

Here we are setting `req.template` to a function. When we do that, Apostrophe calls that function later when it is ready to render the page.

To help us do this conveniently, Apostrophe provides every module with a `renderer` method that returns such a function.

We just provide a template name and, optionally, data to be passed to the function.

Now we can access that data in `views/show.html` within our module.

  "Where is the `goFindSomethingBySlug` function?" That depends on you! The purpose of `apostrophe-custom-pages` is to let you do custom work based on "the rest" of the URL. If you are just looking to display pieces, there is already a great subclass of `apostrophe-custom-pages` for you. Check out [reusable content with pieces](../getting-started/reusable-content-with-pieces.html) and [apostrophe-pieces-pages](../../modules/apostrophe-pieces-pages/index.html).

### `pageBeforeSend`: your last chance to do async work for a page

When Apostrophe renders a page, the last thing it does is invoke the `pageBeforeSend` method of every module that has one.

This is your last chance to attach information to `req.data` and your last chance to do anything that requires a callback.

Your `pageBeforeSend` method will receive `req` and, if you define it with both arguments, `callback` also.

  **Note that `req.data.page` will not always exist in a `pageBeforeSend` handler. Be sure to handle this gracefully.** `pageBeforeSend` is invoked for all full HTML page responses, including the login "page," which does not correspond to an Apostrophe page. 

### Template helpers: invoking synchronous JavaScript code from your template

You have one more chance to write JavaScript that is part of the rendering of a page.

Apostrophe provides many "template helpers" you've seen before, like `apos.area` or `apos.attachments.url`. Adding helpers is a good way to provide code that would be too ugly, complicated or unmaintainable written in Nunjucks.

Just remember that the code must be synchronous ‚Äî it must not involve callbacks. If you need callbacks to do your work, use a `pageBeforeSend` method.

Here's how to add a helper via your module:

```javascript
// in lib/modules/your-module/index.js
module.exports = {
  alias: 'myModule',
  construct: function(self, options) {
    self.addHelpers({
      clap: function(s) {
        // Replace spaces with claps
        return s.replace(/ /g, 'üëè');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

```
{# in any template #}
{{ apos.clap(data.page.title) }}
```

#### Rendering HTML inside a helper

By default, the output of your helper will be automatically escaped, so that `<` becomes `&lt;` and so on, in order to prevent XSS attacks.

If you need to output markup, you can do that with `self.apos.templates.safe`. When you do so, escaping any user-entered text becomes **your responsibility**:

```javascript
// in lib/modules/your-module/index.js
module.exports = {
  alias: 'myModule',
  construct: function(self, options) {
    self.addHelpers({
      header: function(s) {
        // Encapsulate in an h1 tag. Escape
        // the string as HTML!
        return self.apos.templates.safe('<h1>' + self.apos.utils.escapeHtml(s) + '</h1>');
      }
    });
  }
}
```

#### Accessing `req` inside a helper

If you need to, you can access `req` inside a helper function as:

```
self.apos.templates.contextReq
```

This is safe because template rendering is synchronous. There is no possibility that this value will change until the page template is completely rendered.

#### Rendering another template from inside a helper

Sometimes it's convenient to render another template from inside a helper. And you can. Just remember that you must use `self.partial`, not `self.render`. `self.render` requires a `req` object, while `self.partial` automatically uses `self.apos.templates.contextReq`. An example:

```javascript
// inside lib/modules/your-module/index.js
self.addHelpers({
  address: function(piece) {
    return self.partial('address', { piece: piece });
  }
});
```

```
{# inside any template #}
{% for piece in data.pieces %}
  {{ address(piece) }}
{% endfor %}
```

This will render the `views/address.html` template of your module, passing the piece as `data.piece`.

### Rendering a full HTML page from a route

Thinking about rendering a full HTML page from an Express route? Most of the time, you'll want to use `apostrophe-custom-pages` instead, as described above. The `dispatch` feature gives you everything you need to respond to URLs in creative ways.

However, you can also call `self.sendPage` to render a full HTML page via Apostrophe:

```javascript
self.apos.app.get('/special-url', function(req, res) {
  // Get some data first, then...
  return self.sendPage(req, self.renderer('special'), { ... optional data here ... });
});
```

Note that `pageBeforeSend` methods are invoked first before the template is rendered.

  `sendPage` completes your response to the Express request. There is no need to call `res.send` afterwards and it will not work if you try. If you need to do anything special to the Express `res` object before the response is sent, do that first, accessing it via `req.res`.
