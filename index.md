# Everything You Need To Know

Apostrophe is a user-friendly content management system powered by node.js. All editing is performed in-context. Our documentation covers everything from installation to frontend development to advanced backend techniques. For a solid foundation, start with the first topic and just keep going. Or just skip around. It's OK, we know you're going to. Just promise to read at least "getting started" first.

## Topics

* [Getting started](howtos/getting-started/index.html)
* [Frontend development](howtos/frontend-development/index.html)
* [Snippets: custom content types](howtos/snippets/index.html)
