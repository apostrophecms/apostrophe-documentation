#### Apostrophe Is Easy

Apostrophe is a design-driven, in-context CMS built on Node.js and MongoDB. It provides the tools to develop both simple and complex content-driven websites through simple templating and modular functionality. The editing experience is designed around the idea that content mangement should be easy, and therefore editors can create and manage their content right on the page itself.

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">
    <img src="images/node.png" class="retina-image">
  </a>
  <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="blank">
    <img src="images/mongo.png" class="retina-image">
  </a>
</div>

Apostrophe is built on an accessible technology stack that focuses on ease of use as well as performance. Node.js provides an easy entry point for front-end Javascript developers and a playground for experienced back-end developers. The Nunjucks templating language allows for easily including data and editable content on any page. And MongoDB provides the necessary speed to serve Apostrophe’s content-driven pages.

#### Apostrophe is Robust
Apostrophe is in use for many kinds of websites, from small nonprofits and companies to colleges and research platforms. Since its inception, it has been iteratively built in the context of creating real websites. This has led to an ecosystem of modular functionality, allowing developers to solve problems precisely. You can see the different kinds of functionality on some of the websites built with Apostrophe:

#### Apostrophe is Human
Through changes in technology, Apostrophe has grown enormously in capability but has always stuck to its principles by putting the user first.

The Apostrophe project is led by [P'unk Avenue](http://punkave.com), a design and build firm with a special focus on positive social impact, urbanism, health & wellness, arts & culture, and education. Giving back to the open source community is part of that focus.
