Once you have the design and content for your site mapped out, you need to define what kind of users your site will have and how they will interact with your site. To do this, you'll learn to use Apostrophe's basic groups to manage permissions, and then to customize groups with more powerful, granular permissions control.

This section also contains information on setting up Apostrophe Passport for single sign-on capabilities, and information about Apostrophe's password recovery and account lockout features.
