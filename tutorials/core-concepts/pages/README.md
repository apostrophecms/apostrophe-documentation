At its root, any website is a collection of pages which contain content and applications and are connected through navigation. Maybe a site is a single page with a blog, or maybe it's 100s of complex pages integrated with a web application for cataloging photographs. Either way, it all starts with pages, and how you use them to connect users with content.
