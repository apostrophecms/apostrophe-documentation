# Widgets, Singletons, and Areas

Central to Apostrophe is the philosophy that editors can edit their content in context. In order for you to enable this functionality in your templates, Apostrophe provides `singleton` and `area` helpers. Within those singletons and areas, the objects that you add to a page are called `widgets`.

## Singletons

A Singleton is a space on a page that allows an editor to add a single "widget" of a specific type.

### Example: Creating a Rich Text Editor as a Singleton

If you're following along, you created a `default.html` template in the previous article. As an example, we'll add a rich text singleton to your `default.html` template. If you're not following along, you can use `home.html` or another file in your local project.

1. Open `default.html`.

2. Replace the `main` block with this: 

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="lib/modules/apostrophe-pages/views/default.html" %}
    ```markup
    {% block main %}
      <div class="main-content">
        {{ apos.singleton(data.page, 'textBlock', 'apostrophe-rich-text', {
          toolbar: [ 'Bold', 'Italic' ]
        }) }}
      </div>
    {% endblock %}
    ```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Let's deconstruct the arguments we are passing here.

#### `data.page`

The page object you want to save the singleton to. In this case, we are editing content on the current page, so the content should be saved to that page.

#### `'textBlock'`

The name of the area. This denotes what property the singleton will be saved to in the page object. In this case, it would be saved to `data.page['textBlock']`.

#### `'apostrophe-rich-text'`

The widget type we want to allow in the singleton. In this case, we are using the standard rich text widget.

#### `{ toolbar: [ 'Bold', 'Italic' ] }`

An "options" object that allows us to pass type-specific options to the widget. Rich text widgets support a `toolbar` option.

If we restart our server and refresh our site's home page while logged in, we'll see a gray block with a button prompting us to add rich text. Once you start adding text, your edits save automatically. **There is no "save" button because you don't need one.** All edits are saved in the background.

## Areas

An Area, is like a Singleton, a space on the page where an editor can add a widget. Unlike a Singleton, you can add any number of widgets inside of an area, and you can define multiple types of widgets that can be added within a single area. When we use the area helper a "+" sign appears on the page, allowing the user to add a new widget in a series \(usually a vertical column\), often alternating between images and rich text.

### Example: Creating an Area with Multiple Widgets

To see this in action, add an `apos.area` to a page template.

1. Open `default.html`

2. Add this to `default.html` below the Singleton you just added inside the main `div`:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="lib/modules/apostrophe-pages/views/default.html" %}
    ```markup
    {{ apos.area(data.page, 'body', {
      widgets: {
        'apostrophe-rich-text': {
          toolbar: [ 'Bold', 'Italic' ]
        },
        'apostrophe-images': {
          size: 'full'
        }
      }
    }) }}
    ```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

The first two arguments for this helper work the same way as for `apos.singleton`. The third option is an options object. We can see that that options object supports a `widgets` option, which takes a key-value map of available widget names and their respective options.

{% hint style='info' %}
Not sure how to add a second widget? After you're finished editing rich text, click anywhere outside of the rich text widget. Then hover over it and you'll see the "+" signs in each position where you're allowed to add a new widget.
{% endhint %}

With this, you've learned how to complete two of the most important tasks in any CMS: creating new pages and adding content to those pages. Next you'll learn how to connect pages with Navigation.
